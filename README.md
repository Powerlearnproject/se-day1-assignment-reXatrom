#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer: Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications in a structured and efficient way. It importance in technology industry are the following; improve efficiency, enhance scalability etc.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer:
    1. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
    2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
    3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
