#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer: Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications in a structured and efficient way. It importance in technology industry are the following; improve efficiency, enhance scalability etc.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer:
    1. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
    2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
    3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer:
    1. Requirements: this is the gathering and documenting of user needs and system requirements.
    2. Design: this is creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
    3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
    4. Deployment: This is releasing the software to users or customers.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer:
    1. Comparison of waterfall and agile methodologies are, the approach, project scope, flexibility, testing, delivery etc.
    2. Contrast: while waterfall feature the sequential and step by step process, agile adapt the iterative and flexible process. Also, waterfall is rigid that is changes are difficult, agile is highly flexible, allows frequent changes.

    When to use waterfall: Developing medical software.
    When to use agile: Mobile app development.


5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer: 
    1. A software developer: is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
    2. A Quality Assurance Engineer: is responsible for ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
    3. A project manager: they are responsible for overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer: 
   a. Integrated Development Environments are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing codes eg visual studio, Eclipse, sublime text.
   b. Version Control system are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg git.
   

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer:
    a. changing requirements
    b. tight deadlines
    c. technical debt

    Strategies for overcoming challenges includes effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer:
    Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
    Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
    System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
    Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer: Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It helps avoiding confusing answers by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer: 
    Vague prompt: Write about technology
    Improve prompt: Write a 500-word article discussing the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market, including both benefits and challenges.

    Its a clear and specific prompt leads to more useful and targeted content.
